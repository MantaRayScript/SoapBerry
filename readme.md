# SoapBerry Project

Hello everyone! :wave: This little project was originally meant to be for the SheCodes challenge, however I didn't have enough time to send it for it. Nevertheless I decided to continue the project for the portfolio purpose and mostly for experience in coding. Hope you'll enjoy the project.

## About The Project

This is a Landing Page for the fictional eco beauty products company called SoapBerry. The SoapBerry sells beauty products such as facial creams, makeup, soaps, etc. It uses natural products and follows green energy and zero waste mission, where the energy comes from sun and wind energy, most ingredients are local and without pesticides, and cosmetics packaging are either reusable or renewable.<br>
I decided to focus on simplicity of the website and on not creating an online shop yet (at least for now). This site is for a small startup company which doesn't have an online shop yet and is distributing their products to the small eco/zero waste shops, mostly locally.<br>
I believe, I will turn this project into an online shop when I get advanced in programming. Right now it is a long road to the level I want to achieve.

## Contributing

If you found a mistake that should be fixed, please let me know. I'm still learning and I'm aware that I might have them here. :sweat_smile:
